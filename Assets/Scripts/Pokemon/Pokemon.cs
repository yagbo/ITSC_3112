# Pokemon Class Documentation


The `Pokemon` class represents a Pok√©mon entity within a game. This is the pokemon object
that is created when we create a pokemon in unity. We can add them by right clicking,
and creating a Pokemon game object, then we will add all the required information. 
This object is also used to keep track of the HP and PP of the moves it has learned.
